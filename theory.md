### Theory

<div>
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size 128-bit hash value from variable-length input data. This proposal outlines an educational exercise to simulate the MD5 hashing process through a web-based application, providing students with a practical understanding of how MD5 works.

###### Use Of MD5 Algorithm:

- It is used for file authentication.
- In a web application, it is used for security purposes. e.g. Secure password of users etc.
- Using this algorithm, We can store our password in 128 bits format.

###### Application Of MD5 Algorithm:

- We use message digest to verify the integrity of files/ authenticates files.
- MD5 was used for data security and encryption.
- It is used to Digest the message of any size and also used for Password verification.
- For Game Boards and Graphics.

###### Advantages of MD5 Algorithm:

- MD5 is faster and simple to understand.
- MD5 algorithm generates a strong password in 16 bytes format. All developers like web developers etc use the MD5 algorithm to secure the password of users.
- To integrate the MD5 algorithm, relatively low memory is necessary.
- It is very easy and faster to generate a digest message of the original message.</div>
