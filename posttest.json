      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 is known for its low computational cost.",
        "b": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Collision resistance is a property that MD5 lacks.",
        "c": "Explanation: The MD5 algorithm is vulnerable to length extension attacks, where an attacker can append data to the hash and still produce a valid hash. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",
